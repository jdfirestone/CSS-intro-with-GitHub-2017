All of the above. Plus:

* Your CSS validates [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

* Your colors demonstrate a careful selection of colors that look good together.

* All hexadecimal RGB codes are used correctly (no color names are used).

* All punctuation marks and symbols required in the CSS file are used correctly.

* The CSS and HTML are formatted neatly. Use linespaces and indents like a professional so the code is easy to read.

## DISHONESTY

Showing your code to any other student, or giving another student code to solve the problem, or any part of the problem, is a violation of the university's honor code. Asking for a solution in any online forum is a violation of the university's honor code. Copying code from another student, past or present, is a violation of the university's honor code. Allowing anyone else to write code for you is a violation of the university's honor code. You must do your own work, or risk a failing grade for the entire course. Penalties for academic dishonesty are spelled out in the syllabus for this course.
